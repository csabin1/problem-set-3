    <p>Throughout USA swimming history, there have been numerous famous Olympians, 
      who are noted for their accomplishments in swimming. Some of them are very well-known: Michael Phelps, for example. 
      However, there are also those who are not as well-known, such as Lily King. To be considered an Olympian, you must 
      medal at the Olympics, whether it be gold, silver, or bronze in an individual event or a relay. Noted below are 
      four swimmers-two females and two male-who are Olympians.
