    <h2>An Overview of Swimming</h2>
    <p>
      Commonly mistaken as a hobby, swimming has been around for many years, with the
      first record of it being 7,000 years ago. While many people believe that swimming just
      consists of you moving your arms and kicking your legs in the pool, there is much more
      involved within the sport. Your workout, practice level, and diet all come into play
      if you want to be serious about swimming. You have a lot of freedom within the sport,
      whether you want to do it for fun, for exercise, or if you want to get into college
      for swimming.
